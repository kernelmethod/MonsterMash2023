# Mycogrigoric Alcoves

This mod adds _mycogrigori_, a society of fungal-human symbiotes who occupy
ancient waygates left by the Eaters.

## Features

* Adds waygates for mycogrigori alcoves, which are an uncommon spawn in baroque
  ruins.
* Several new living graft items:
  * Fungal brainspikes, a new long blade that attacks mental armor and applies
    holographic bleeding.
  * Fungal whipcleaves, an agility-scaling axe that grants adrenal control.
  * Extrasensory tentacles, a new mask that provides bioscanning and the Sense
    Psychic mutation.
