        We are mycogrigori, the union of humanity and fungi, who have shed the solitude of single-beingness.

        This hideaway provides asylum to our fellow mycogrigori. Many humans do not look kindly upon the idea of collective existence. We challenge their self-concept, so more often than not we are met with violence.

        As for this alcove? It lies on the other end of a great tunnel across the cosmos. Sadly, the Eaters never left a starmap for their waygates; so we cannot say where we are in relation to Qud.

        A waygate, =player.formalAddressTerm=, a passage across the stars.

        From what we can gather, as the Eater's interstellar empire approached its zenith, the land of Qud was carved up and staked out by the gentry. Many in the lower castes were forced out of their homes; those who were allowed to remain had astronomical rents levied upon them.

        As the heavens above reached down and beckoned the people of Qud into its embrace, the cybernauts of the time concocted a solution: a contraption that could spacefold passengers across vast distances. Hundreds of hermetically-sealed alcoves were constructed on remote asteroids and connected via a waygate network, where they served as a refuge for the dispossessed.

        Alas, waygates posed an existential threat to one of the aristocracy's most powerful yokes, and they were quickly outlawed. Few were ever produced, and fewer yet remain functional to this day.
