        We are mycogrigori, the union of humanity and fungi. We have shed the solitude of single-beingness and now share our minds and bodies.

        A waygate, =player.formalAddressTerm=, a passage across the stars.

        From what we can gather, as the Eater's interstellar empire approached its zenith, the land of Qud was carved up and staked out by the gentry. Many in the lower castes were forced out of their homes; those who were allowed to remain had astronomical rents levied upon them.

        As the heavens above reached down and beckoned the people of Qud into its embrace, the cybernauts of the time concocted a solution: waygates that could spacefold their entrants across vast distances. Hundreds of hermetically-sealed alcoves were constructed on remote asteroids and connected to waygates, where they served as a refuge for the dispossessed.

        Alas, waygates posed an existential threat to one of the aristocracy's most powerful yokes, and they were quickly outlawed. Few were ever produced, and fewer yet remain intact to this day.
